# cld3-ruby
cld3-ruby is an interface of [Compact Language Detector v3 (CLD3)](https://github.com/google/cld3) for Ruby.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cld3'

cld3 = CLD3::NNetLanguageIdentifier.new(0, 1000)

cld3.find_language("こんにちは") # => #<struct Struct::Result language=:ja, probability=1.0, reliable?=true, proportion=1.0, byte_ranges=[]>

cld3.find_language("This is a pen.") # => #<struct Struct::Result language=:en, probability=0.9999408721923828, reliable?=true, proportion=1.0, byte_ranges=[]>

cld3.find_language("здравствуйте") # => #<struct Struct::Result language=:ru, probability=0.3140212297439575, reliable?=false, proportion=1.0, byte_ranges=[]>
```

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* C++ compiler
* [Protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
* [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/)
* [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/)

### Instructions
I (Akihiko Odaki) recommend to setup this library installing via `gem`.

You can also build this library by yourself. `Rakefile` includes a Rake task to
put this code into files buildable as a gem. Build a gem with `rake` command.

### Platform-specific information

#### FreeBSD
FreeBSD port is available as `rubygem-cld3` in `textproc` category.

https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/textproc/rubygem-cld3/

#### JRuby
JRuby has a bug which prevents the feature detection. Apply the following
change:
https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/4118/commits/edad375ef4dcf195b19ce0afe4befac66468c736

### Troubleshooting
`gem install cld3` triggers native library building. If it fails, it is likely
that some required facilities are missing. Make sure C++ compiler is installed.
I recommend [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) as a C++ compiler.
Ruby is likely to need [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
as well.

Runtime errors are likely to be issues of [FFI](https://github.com/ffi/ffi) or
programming errors. Make sure they are all correct.

If you cannot identify the cause of your problem, run spec of this library and
see whether the problem is reproducible with it or not. Spec is not included in
the gem, so clone the source code repository and then run `rake spec`.

In case you cannot solve your problem by yourself and cannot help abandoning or
find an issue in this library, please open an issue at
https://github.com/akihikodaki/cld3-ruby/issues.

If you found an issue and managed to fix it and agree to share the fix under
[Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), please open a pull
request at https://github.com/akihikodaki/cld3-ruby/pulls. Your contribution
would be appreciated by other users and recorded with Git.

## Versioning

The version has 3 parts: major, minor, and patch. They are joined with . as
delimiters in the order.

The increment of the major version and the minor version indicates it can involve
any change.

The increment of the patch version indicates there is no change of the supported
languages and no change of the existing APIs.
